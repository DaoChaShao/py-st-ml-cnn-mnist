**INTRODUCTION**
---
This application demonstrates how to train and evaluate a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** on the classic **MNIST
handwritten digits dataset**, with an interactive interface built using **Streamlit**.  
Compared to a traditional Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP), CNNs are better suited for image tasks, since convolutional
layers can automatically learn local features such as edges, textures, and shapes, leading to higher accuracy in image
recognition.

Within the app, users can:

- Visualize the training and validation process of a CNN model
- Explore the effects of different convolutional layers and parameter settings
- Draw digits in real-time and test the modelâ€™s inference ability

**DATA DESCRIPTION**
---
The **MNIST dataset** is one of the most widely used benchmark datasets in machine learning and computer vision. Key
properties include:

- **Dataset size**
    - Training set: 60,000 grayscale images of size 28Ã—28
    - Test set: 10,000 grayscale images of size 28Ã—28

- **Image content**
    - Each image represents a handwritten digit from 0 to 9
    - Images are **single-channel grayscale**, with pixel values ranging from 0 to 255

- **Task objective**
    - Input: a 28Ã—28 grayscale handwritten digit image
    - Output: predict the corresponding digit class (0â€“9)

This project helps users **understand the advantages of CNNs in image classification** and provides a hands-on
comparison between CNNs and MLPs on the MNIST dataset.

**FEATURES**
---

- **Data Loading & Preprocessing:** Load MNIST dataset and preprocess for MLP training (flattening and normalization).
- **Model Training:** Train a Multi-Layer Perceptron with configurable epochs, batch size, and validation split.
- **Real-time Training Metrics:** Monitor loss, accuracy, precision, recall, and AUC for both training and validation
  sets.
- **Model Testing:** Evaluate model performance with accuracy and RÂ² score on the test set.
- **Real-time Digit Recognition:** Draw digits on a canvas and get immediate predictions using the trained model.
- **Visualization Tools:** Scatter plots and decision boundary visualization for 2D/3D datasets (for experiments beyond
  MNIST).
